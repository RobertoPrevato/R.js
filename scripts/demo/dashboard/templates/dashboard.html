<h2>scalability made easy!</h2>
<h4>R.js makes easy to load scripts in blocks (as they become needed), and fire callbacks when dependencies are ready</h4>
<ol> 
	<li>all entities in this page are loaded in the <strong>wrong</strong> order (see the page source code and the script elements)</li>
	<li>R.js executes the modules functions in the right order, to satisfy dependencies</li>
	<li>why is it easier? because R.js doesn't throw exception if a dependency is not available for a module: it waits, until eventually it will come</li>
	<li>Live example: click the button below to simulate the dynamic loading of JavaScript for a new area, after a delay (like an AJAX call)</li>
</ol>
<div class="spa-demo">
	<button class="btn btn-warning" data-bind="click: spademo">Click to load a new area (partial view)</button>
	<hr />
	<canvas id="canvas" width="0" height="0"></canvas>
	<div id="partial"></div>
	<br class="break" />
</div>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Supports asynchronous module definition</li>
	<li>Keeps synchronous what can stay synchronous</li>
	<li>Evaluates the function that defines an object, only when all dependencies are ready</li>
	<li>Includes grunt task to implement <strong>super minification</strong> (minification of objects keys)</li>
</ol>
