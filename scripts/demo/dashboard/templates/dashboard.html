<h2>scalability made easy!</h2>
<h4>R.js makes easy to load scripts in blocks (as they become needed), and fire callbacks when dependencies are ready</h4>
<p>all entities, except third party libraries, in this page are loaded in the <strong>wrong</strong> order (see the page source code and the script elements).<br />R.js executes the modules functions in the right order, to satisfy dependencies.</p>
<h4>why is it easier?</h4>
<ol>
	<li>R.js doesn't throw exception if a module is defined and its dependencies are not available: instead it waits until the dependencies will eventually become available</li>
	<li>R.js doesn't inject script tags in your head: it cares just about the business logic and executing functions, that's it!</li>
	<li>You can define as many modules as you desire in a single file: thanks to point 2., there is no connection between scripts location (src) and what they contain; this behavior differs from RequireJs and is similar to Angular mechanism, which allows to define multiple things in the same file.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Live example</h4>
<p>click the button below to simulate the dynamic loading of JavaScript for a new area, after a delay (like an AJAX call)</p>
<div class="spa-demo">
	<button class="btn btn-warning" data-bind="click: spademo">Click to load a new area (partial view)</button>
	<hr />
	<canvas id="canvas" width="0" height="0"></canvas>
	<div id="partial"></div>
	<br class="break" />
</div>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Supports asynchronous module definition</li>
	<li>Keeps synchronous what can stay synchronous</li>
	<li>Evaluates the function that defines an object, only when all dependencies are ready</li>
	<li>Includes grunt task to implement minify and obfuscate the module keys <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/robscure">robscure</a></li>
